## Project Summary

Our goal for this project went through many iterations, trying to figure out a project that was feasible and would pique our interest. We had some crazy ideas before (agent battle royale), but settled on prediction of each pixel of the player perspective. This includes labeling of Minecraft structures including trees, house, and lake as classes. The obstacle was using Malmo's functionality to get location of block, determine whether or not it was in player's view, figure the type of block/entity, and the structure that it was apart of. Part of our list of prioirities included increasing efficiency of our model which was evaluated using the metrics explained in the Evaluation section. 


## Approaches



## Evaluation

The first means of evaluation was the kmeans
