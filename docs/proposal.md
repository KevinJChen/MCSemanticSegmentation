## Summary of the Project 
The goal of our project is to segment and label different structures and items in minecraft as our player walks through an environment. An example of a structure that would be classified would be a tree or a sky with clouds. Every important detail in the playerâ€™s view should be labeled correctly and efficiently. 

## AI/ML Algorithms
Using Unet for semantic segmentation, deep Q learning for reinforcement learning.

## Evaluation Plan
The success of the project can be determined in a similar manner to our performance validation where classification and location accuracy success can be evaluated. The project can also include a runtime output that will measure the efficiency. The runtime should decrease as the player walks through the minecraft world as part of a learning algorithm.
